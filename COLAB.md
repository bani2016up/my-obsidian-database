# Collaboration Policy

## 🤝 Merge Request Guidelines

### ✅ Accepted Contributions  
We welcome merge requests that:  
- **Expand existing topics** (e.g., adding new proofs to `Proves/`)  
- **Add relevant concepts** (mathematics/linear algebra focus)  
- **Fix technical errors** in formulas or definitions  
- **Improve organization** (better note linking/structure)  

### ❌ Out-of-Scope  
Requests will likely be declined if they:  
- Duplicate existing notes without adding value  
- Contain opinionated/non-factual content  

## ⚙️ Submission Process  
1. **Open an Issue first** to discuss major changes  
2. **Reference academic sources** for new concepts  
3. **Maintain consistent formatting** (LaTeX for equations)  
4. **Keep commits focused** - one concept per MR  

> 📌 Pro Tip: Check `Arithmetics/` and `Proves/` for examples of preferred style  

**Maintainer's Note**: While I may not accept all contributions, every serious MR will receive thoughtful feedback.
