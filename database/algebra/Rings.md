# Rings and Fields: Definitions, Properties, and Examples

## Definition of a Ring

A **ring** is a set \( R \) equipped with two binary operations: addition \((+)\) and multiplication \((\cdot)\), satisfying the following:

### Structure

- \(R\) is a set.
- Addition: $$( + : R \times R \to R )$$, defined by $$((x,y) \mapsto x + y)$$.
- Multiplication: $$( \cdot : R \times R \to R )$$, defined by $$((x,y) \mapsto xy)$$.

### Axioms

1. \((R, +)\) is an abelian group:
   - **Associativity:** \(x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z\) for all \(x,y,z \in R\).
   - **Identity element:** There exists $$(0 \in R)$$ such that \(0 + x = x + 0 = x\).
   - **Additive inverses:** For each $$(x \in R)$$, there exists $$(-x \in R)$$ such that $$(x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0)$$.
   - **Commutativity:** \(x + y = y + x\) for all $$(x,y \in R)$$.

2. Multiplication is **distributive** over addition:
   - Left distributivity: \( x(y + z) = xy + xz \).
   - Right distributivity: \((x + y)z = xz + yz\).

3. Multiplication is **associative**:
   - \(a(bc) = (ab)c\) for all $$(a,b,c \in R)$$.

4. A ring with a multiplicative identity:
   - There exists $$(1 \in R)$$ (distinct from \(0\)) such that $$(1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a)$$ for all $$(a \in R)$$.

### Additional Structures

- A **commutative ring** satisfies \( ab = ba \) for all $$(a,b \in R)$$.
- A **field** is a commutative ring in which every nonzero element is invertible:
  - For $$(x \neq 0)$$, there exists $$(x^{-1} \in R)$$ such that $$(x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = 1)$$.
  - The multiplicative identity satisfies $$(1 \neq 0)$$.

## Explicit Construction (Optional)

Rings can be explicitly constructed through sets with defined addition and multiplication operations. For example:

- **Polynomial rings:** $$(A[x] = \{a_0 + a_1 x + \ldots + a_n x^n \mid a_i \in A\})$$, where \(A\) is a ring.
- **Matrix rings:** $$(M_n(R))$$, the set of $$(n \times n)$$ matrices with entries in ring $$(R)$$, with usual matrix addition and multiplication.

---

## Key Properties of Rings and Fields

- **Invertibility:** In a ring \(R\), an element \(x\) is *invertible* if there exists $$(x^{-1})$$ with $$(xx^{-1} = x^{-1} x = 1)$$. The set of invertible elements forms a group, called the *unit group* $$(R^*)$$.
- **Zero divisors:** 
  - A *left zero-divisor* is a nonzero element $$(x \in R)$$ such that $$(xy = 0)$$ for some nonzero \(y\).
  - A *right zero-divisor* is an element $$(x \in R)$$ such that $$(yx = 0)$$ for some nonzero \(y\).
  - The union of left and right zero-divisors forms the set of zero-divisors \(D(R)\).
- Multiplying any element by zero yields zero: $$(x \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot x = 0)$$.

## Examples

1. **Trivial ring:**
   - $$(R = \{\ast\})$$ with operations $$(\ast + \ast = \ast)$$ and $$(\ast \cdot \ast = \ast)$$.
   - This is a ring with one element where $$(\ast)$$ acts as both \(0\) and \(1\).

2. **Integers:**
   - $$((\mathbb{Z}, +, \cdot))$$ is a commutative ring with unity (1).
   - Not a field: only \(1\) and \(-1\) are invertible.

3. **Rational numbers:**
   - \($$(\mathbb{Q}, +, \cdot)$$) is a field, every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.

4. **Modular integers:**
   - $$(\mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\})$$ with addition and multiplication modulo \(n\).
   - A commutative ring; specifically, when \(n\) is prime, $$(\mathbb{Z}_n)$$ is a field.

5. **Matrix ring:**
   - $$(M_n(R))$$, the ring of \(n \times n\) matrices over \(R\), generally noncommutative.

6. **Polynomial ring:**
   - \(A[x]\), polynomials with coefficients in \(A\), is a commutative ring if \(A\) is commutative.

## Subrings

A **subring** \(T \subseteq R\) satisfies:

1. \(T\) is a subset of \(R\).
2. \((T, +)\) is a subgroup of \((R, +)\).
3. \(T\) is closed under multiplication: $$(x,y \in T \Rightarrow xy \in T)$$.
4. The multiplicative identity \(1_R \in T\).

### Examples of Subrings

- $$(\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \subseteq \mathbb{R}[x])$$.
- The subring of scalar multiples of the identity matrix $$(\{\lambda I \mid \lambda \in R\} \subseteq M_n(R))$$.

## Zero-Divisors Detailed

Let:


- $$(Dl(R) = \{x \in R \mid \exists y \neq 0: xy = 0\})$$ be the set of left zero-divisors.
- $$(Dr(R) = \{x \in R \mid \exists y \neq 0: yx = 0\})$$ be the set of right zero-divisors.
- The full set of zero-divisors is $$(D(R) = Dl(R) \cup Dr(R))$$.

Examples include:

- Matrices that are nilpotent (e.g., strictly upper-triangular matrices in \($$M_n(R)$$)).
- Idempotent elements (satisfying \($$e^2 = e$$)) that are zero divisors.
