### Orthogonal and Orthonormal Systems in Vector Spaces

#### Definition

Let ( V \) be an inner product space with dimension \( n \), and let  
$$
 S = \{ e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \} \subseteq V 
$$
be a set of vectors in \( V \).

- **Orthogonal system**: The set \( S \) is called **orthogonal** if for every pair \( (i, j) \),  
- $$
  
  \langle e_i, e_j \rangle =
  \begin{cases}
  > 0 & \text{if } i = j \\
  0 & \text{if } i \neq j
  \end{cases}
  
- $$
  
- **Orthonormal system**: The set \( S \) is called **orthonormal** if  
$$
  \langle e_i, e_j \rangle =
  \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } i = j \\
  0 & \text{if } i \neq j
  \end{cases}
$$

Here, $$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\ $$denotes the inner product, and $$||e_i|| = \sqrt{\langle e_i, e_i \rangle} $$denotes the norm of the vector $$e_i $$.

#### Explicit Construction (Optional)

Given an orthogonal system \( S = \{ e_1, \ldots, e_n \} \), the corresponding orthonormal system can be constructed by normalizing each vector:  
$$
S' = \left\{ \frac{e_1}{||e_1||}, \frac{e_2}{||e_2||}, \ldots, \frac{e_n}{||e_n||} \right\}
$$

#### Key Properties

1. Every orthonormal set is a linearly independent set.
2. If \( S \) is orthonormal and contains \( n \) vectors in an \( n \)-dimensional space \( V \), then \( S \) forms an **orthonormal basis** for \( V \).
3. Orthogonal systems simplify computations of vector projections, expansions, and transformations because they allow components to be obtained by simple inner products.

#### Examples

- The standard basis vectors in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$,  
- $$
  e_1 = (1, 0, \ldots, 0), \quad e_2 = (0, 1, 0, \ldots, 0), \ldots, e_n = (0, \ldots, 0, 1),  
- $$
  form an orthonormal system with respect to the standard dot product.

- In $$\mathbb{R}^2 $$, the vectors $$ (1, 1) $$ and $$(1, -1) $$ are orthogonal but not orthonormal. After normalization,  

$$
  
  \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right), \quad \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)
  
$$
  become an orthonormal system.

#### Applications

- **Fourier series**: The set of functions \(\{ \sin(nx), \cos(nx) \}\) form an orthogonal system that is critical in expressing functions as sums of sines and cosines.
- **Quantum mechanics**: Orthonormal bases represent possible states and allow clear computation of probabilities.
- **Numerical analysis and computer graphics**: Orthonormal bases are employed to simplify transformations and reduce computational complexity.

#### Other Fields

- **Signal processing**: Orthogonal and orthonormal bases underlie wavelet decompositions and filter design.
- **Machine learning**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) constructs orthonormal bases to represent data in lower dimensions efficiently.
